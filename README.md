## 📝 Notes & Limitations
- Benefit calculations follow only the rules explicitly stated and do not apply any equivalence theory
- Only benefit formulas are based on the referenced regulations; age limits, salary values, and salary growth ratios are not validated against regulatory standards
- Discount rates and present value concepts are not incorporated
- Provides simplified calculations and does not represent a full actuarial pension model
